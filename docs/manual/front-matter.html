<h3 id="1-1-introduction"><span class="heading-text">1-1 Introduction</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h3>
<p>This document is comprised of five flow diagrams designed to help the test team determine how to handle an observed deficiency.   In simple terms, a deficiency is anything observed that prevents or delays the operator/maintainer in performing the operation and or maintenance of the System Under Test (SUT).</p>
<p>The deficiency may result in a recommendation, Operational Consideration (OPCON), Tactical Consideration (TACON), Blue Sheet (SUT Deficiency), Gold Sheet (System of System (SoS)  Deficiency), and or an Operational Notation (OPNOTE) within the Commander's Report.</p>
<p>There are five flow diagram figures that take the reader from start to finish in the deficiency analysis process.   These diagrams are designed to provide guidance to the test team.  Each decision point should be discussed within the group to determine which way the obtained test data is leading.</p>
<p>Some systems can be analyzed in a Qualitative means, others in a Quantitative.  The flow diagrams support both methods, but requires the test team to determine which one is the best to use for the SUT.</p>
<p>There are notes throughout the figures that need to be read before starting the flow diagram.  These notes frame the reference for use of the applicable diagram.</p>
<p>Figure 1 is the Deficiency Flow Start diagram.  This figure is designed to help the test team determine what type of deficiency they are dealing with.  The results of Figure 1 will either send the team to the Operational Mission Failure flow diagram, or the Qualitative/Quantitative flow diagrams.</p>
<p>Figure 2 is the Operational Mission Failure flow diagram.  This figure is designed to help the test team determine whether the observed deficiency will be treated as an Operational Mission Failure (OMF), failure, or just annotated as an observed deficiency in the results paragraph.</p>
<p>Figure 3 is the Qualitative Baseline Deficiency flow diagram.  This figure is designed to provide the test team with a qualitative means to determine the criticality of the observed deficiency.  The figure is sub-divided into New Equipment Capability deficiency, Existing Capability Replacement deficiency, Support Equipment deficiency, and Deficiency roll-up diagrams.</p>
<p>Figure 4 is the Quantitative Baseline Deficiency flow diagram.  This figure is designed to provide the test team with a quantitative means to determine the criticality of the observed deficiency.  The figure is sub-divided into New Equipment Capability deficiency, Existing Capability Replacement deficiency, Support Equipment deficiency, and Deficiency roll-up diagrams.</p>
<p>Figure 5 is the Binning Flow diagram.  This figure is designed to help the test team determine which COI to bin the deficiency to as a primary and when applicable, secondary.  The figure has the test team considered which measures, tasks, and sub-tasks failed due to the deficiency.  When none are available, binning will occur by using the most closely related annotated  task or sub-task to the task or sub-task that was observed failing.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-1-flow-diagrams"><span class="heading-text">1-1.1 Flow Diagrams</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The New Equipment and Existing Capability deficiency flow diagrams are divided into operational impact and mission criticality determination sections.</p>
<p>The Operational Impact answers the question, How did the deficiency affect the mission operationally.  The answer to the question will either be severely, critically, seriously, moderately, or minor.  Notes are presented at each decision point to help the test team determine the impact level.</p>
<p>You must first determine whether the deficiency is only affecting pre-planning of the SUT mission, which will result in a minor or major impact, or if it is a deficiency that affects SUT mission completion which will result in a serious, critical, or severe impact.</p>
<p>Using the decision tree and notes, determine which situation closely resembles the deficiency impact caused during test.  In situations where there is a mix between a higher and lower impact, use the higher impact determination.  Each decision tree point has a caveat statement in parenthesis (i.e., Mission Execution takes longer than planned, or Mission execution requires a work around).  These caveat statements are later used in the criticality determination section of the flow diagram.</p>
<p>The Mission Criticality answers the question; How critical is the deficiency to mission accomplishment.  The answer to the question will either be Severe, Major 1, Major 2, Major 3, or Minor.</p>
<p>After determining the impact to mission accomplishment, you must then determine the acceptability of the impact caveat used in the first step.  (I.e. a delay in mission start but no affect to mission completion is a moderate affect to mission accomplishment.  Is that mission start delay acceptable?)  In an instance where the product (mission completion) is the primary concern, the answer might be yes.  In an instance where the process (all steps leading to mission completion) is the primary concern, the answer might be no.</p>
<p>Below the criticality determination is the deficiency correction recommendation.  The test team should choose what best fits the criticality determination (i.e. Correct prior to next program build/or software release, or Correct as soon as possible).  There are six levels of recommendations.</p>
<p>Example statements are also presented at the bottom of the flow diagrams to provide the test team with a workable sample.</p>
<p>The support Equipment deficiency flow diagram is designed to help the test team determine how critical the deficiency is to use of the support system.  There are several items that fall under the System Under Test (SUT) that are developed to support the SUT in the accomplishment of the mission both directly and indirectly. The criticality of these items must be assessed against their intended mission, not the overall SUT mission.</p>
<p>For example; how well the SUT Technical Manual provides the technician with documented technical support information.  Not, how well the Technical Manual supports the accomplishment of the COI,  or how well the SUT Navy Training Systems Plan (NTSP) provides the fleet with a comprehensive training plan for the SUT, or how well the SUT spare parts inventory meets the determined onboard logistics supportability requirements.</p>
<p>The support system flow diagram is sub-divided into two parts, the Operational Impact and the Utilization Criticality Determination.</p>
<p>The operational impact step helps the test team assess the completeness of the support item, process or procedure.  When an item is governed by instruction, the reference instruction is used to determine the completeness.  When an instruction is not available, Subject Matter Experts (i.e. instructors, senior operators/maintainers /warfare area trainers) should be consulted to determine the completeness of the support item, process or procedure.</p>
<p>Items to be considered support systems are items that do not provide primary system functionality, but support the operation and maintenance of the System Under Test.  (i.e.  Technical Manuals, Quick reference Guides, Built in Test Equipment, tools, parts, materials, Preventative Maintenance Cards, Standard Operating Procedures, etc.)  It is critical that subject matter experts are consulted to determine the availability of the support item, process or procedure.</p>
<p>Utilization criticality guides the test team in determining what over-all affect the deficiency has on the use of the support system or support item.</p>
<p>In situations where there are multiple deficiencies that affect a system, sub-system, or support system, and those deficiencies have an aggregate effect on mission accomplishment, a roll-up deficiency sheet can be generated.  The roll-up deficiency sheet does not replace the individual deficiency sheets.  The roll-up deficiency sheet tells the reader how all the individually related deficiencies combined affect the mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>The roll-up flow diagram asks the test team to determine how acceptable the combined deficiencies are.  The flow diagram results can either keep a deficiency at the same criticality level or increase the criticality level.</p>
<p>This is not a mandatory step and is usually used when there are several low criticality deficiencies on a system, sub-system or support system and the operator/maintainer are observed struggling through operations due to the combined effect of the deficiency.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-2-definitions"><span class="heading-text">1-1.2 Definitions</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>Determining the criticality of a deficiency is highly dependent on everyone working off a standard set of terms and definitions.  The following terms and definitions are used throughout this document.</p>
<p>Acceptable Workaround - A suitable method that will be used temporarily until the problem is fixed.  The workaround must be acceptable to the fleet operator, and have a fix with a planned implementation date by the program office.  The workaround must exist within the SUT and not be the use of another system or function that is not part of the SUT.  Inconvenience to the operator is any work around that that is not intuitive and requires some type of training or muscle memory to ensure successful operation of the SUT.</p>
<p>Critical Impact - Loss of primary application functionality or performance resulting in high number of users unable to perform their normal functions. Major feature/product failure but no loss of existing capabilities; inconvenient workaround or no workaround exists.</p>
<p>Deficiency - A fault, failure, operation or item that is not in accordance with documented guidance, procedure or practice which when observed results in a problem that requires operator interaction or causes and interruption in SUT operation or mission execution.</p>
<p>Existing Capabilities -Existing capabilities are applicable in two manners;</p>
<p>a. The new system replaces a system that provides the operator with specific capabilities and provides enhancements of those previously existing capabilities.</p>
<p>b. The system is receiving an upgrade/technical refresh that will provide enhancements of the currently existing capabilities.</p>
<p>OMF - An OMF is an Operational Mission Fault or Failure that results in a mission not being able to be accomplished.  When a SUT is evaluated under a primary Critical Operational Issue (COI) an OMF will prevent that COI from being accomplished or met.  When a SUT is being evaluated under a supporting COI and OMF will prevent either the primary or supporting COI from being accomplished.</p>
<p>Minor Impact - Total primary functionality or performance exists but less than the threshold requirements and no workaround is required. All existing capabilities exist with no problems.</p>
<p>Moderate Impact - Partial loss of primary application functionality or performance resulting in a low number of users unable to perform their normal functions. No loss of existing capabilities and/or secondary Feature/product intermittently functions; with a workaround that exists.</p>
<p>Multi-Node - A multi-node SUT is one where operation of multiple nodes is required to meet mission accomplishment.  Failure of one node does not prevent the overall mission from being accomplished.</p>
<p>Networked - A networked SUT is one where operation relies on multiple pieces of equipment communicating with each other.  Each piece of the network has to be evaluated to determine whether a failure or fault prevents mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>OPCON - An OPCON is an Operational Consideration that is related to the operation of the SUT.  It is written in a manner to provide a SUT operator with recommendations that can alleviate or prevent SUT shortfalls that have been observed during system testing.</p>
<p>Precludes - Total loss of functionality; new and existing capabilities are not available (prevent from happening; make impossible.</p>
<p>Quantitative - A measured means for evaluating system operation and performance using numerical data thresholds.</p>
<p>Qualitative - A means for evaluating system operation and performance using Subject Matter Expert understanding of the system without using numerical data thresholds.</p>
<p>Serious Impact - Degraded primary application functionality or performance resulting in high number of users unable to perform their normal functions. Major feature/product failure; but no loss of existing capabilities; inconvenient workaround exists.</p>
<p>Stand-Alone - A stand-alone SUT is one where operation of the SUT determines whether the mission can be accomplished.  (I.e. A new computer is being tested.  If the computer does not work, the mission of the computer cannot be supported).</p>
<p>TACON - A TACON is a Tactical Consideration that is related to the operation of the SUT.  It is written in a manner to provide the Commander with tactical recommendations that can alleviate of prevent SUT shortfalls that have been observed during system testing.</p>
<p>Work Around - A workaround is a method, sometimes used temporarily, for achieving a task or goal when the usual or planned method isn't working. In information technology, a workaround is often used to overcome hardware, programming, or communication problems. Once a problem is fixed, a workaround is usually abandoned.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-3-notes-in-this-document"><span class="heading-text">1-1.3 Notes in this document</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>NOTE 1 (Figure 2 Sheet 1 of 3)</p>
<p>SUT Mission Determination</p>
<p>1. Identify the mission of the System Under Test.  (The mission will normally be the primary COI identified when the Integrated Evaluation Framework was generated).*</p>
<p>2. Identify the sub-tasks (sub-missions) that must work to ensure the primary mission can be accomplished. (These will be the sub-tasks that were identified when the Integrated Evaluation Framework was generated).</p>
<p>3. Identify the areas, components, actions, and events that make the sub-task accomplishment possible.  (It is essential that a Mission Task Analysis was properly done at the time of Integrated Evaluation Framework Generation.  If not, a job task analysis must be done before going to test to ensure all operational mission components are identified).</p>
<p>* Some COIs are supportive.  While they still have an assigned mission (i.e. C3 primary mission is Command, Control and Communication), when assessing the effect a deficiency has on a mission, both the primary mission and supported mission(s) must be analyzed to determine whether there is an Operational Mission Failure. (I.e. The Commander may have an alternate means to communicate, but for an ASW mission the SUT is the only means for supporting the ASW mission.) The OMF would be driven by the ASW mission, not the C3 mission.</p>
<p>NOTE 2 (Figure 2 Sheet 1 of 3)</p>
<p>Stand-Alone, Multi-node, Networked</p>
<p>1. Satellite communication system with receive suites is a multi-node SUT where the Satellite has a mission requirement and he receive suite has a mission requirement.  A casualty that prevents either node of the SUT from meeting its mission requirement is an Operational Mission Failure.</p>
<p>2. A firecontrol radar suite with three illuminator radars is a networked system that would be degraded casualty situation</p>
<p>if either one of the illuminators stopped working, but an Operational Mission Failure if they all stopped working.</p>
<p>3. A networked computer suite with a server and satellite computers is a networked system where each satellite computer replicates the capability of the next.  The server going down, or the satellite computers reduced down past a minimum number would be an Operational Mission Failure.</p>
<p>4. A new computer that is designed to work on a network is a standalone system that would be an Operational Mission Failure if that stand alone computer stopped working.</p>
<p>NOTE 3 (Figure 2 Sheet 1 of 3, sheet 2 of 3)</p>
<p>Non-OMF Blue Sheet</p>
<p>Non-OMF Blue sheets should only be generated if the fault or failure has a significant effect on the operation of the system.  (I.e. the system is still operable, but the operator spends a significant amount of time resetting/dealing with the fault or failure.</p>
<p>NOTE 4 (Figure 3 sheet 1 of 4)</p>
<p>Severe Impact</p>
<p>The deficiency prevents the SUT from executing its designed mission or while executing the mission, the deficiency causes the SUT to abort mission support or, the SUT in its intended operational environment cannot perform its designed/intended mission.</p>
<p>NOTE 5 (Figure 3 sheet 1 of 4)</p>
<p>Critical Impact</p>
<p>The deficiency prevents the SUT from operating as intended, but the mission can be completed by implementing a work around or, the SUT in its intended operational environment cannot perform its intended mission as designed, a work around must be used to ensure mission completion.</p>
<p>NOTE 6 (Figure 3 sheet 1 of 4)</p>
<p>Work-Around</p>
<p>A workaround must exist within the SUT and not be the use of another system or function that is not part of the SUT.  Inconvenience to the operator is any work around that that is not intuitive and requires some type of training or muscle memory to ensure successful operation of the SUT.</p>
<p>NOTE 7 (Figure 3 sheet 1 of 4)</p>
<p>Serious Impact</p>
<p>The deficiency does not prevent the SUT from executing its designed mission, but it takes the SUT longer to execute the mission than expected or, the SUT in its intended operational environment can perform its intended mission, but mission time takes longer than expected.</p>
<p>NOTE 8 (Figure 3 sheet 1 of 4)</p>
<p>Moderate Impact</p>
<p>The deficiency causes delays in SUT pre-planning, configuration, and/or startup, delaying planned mission start time, but not affecting overall mission completion or, preparations for SUT operation take longer than planned causing delays in the SUT mission start time, but no effect on mission completion.</p>
<p>NOTE 9 (Figure 3 Sheet 1 of 3, sheet 2 of 4)</p>
<p>Minor Impact</p>
<p>The deficiency causes delays in SOT pre-planning, configuration, and/or startup, but does not delay mission start time or affect overall mission completion or, preparations for  SUT operation take longer than planned, but does not affect mission start, or mission completion.</p>
<p>NOTE 10 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Severely Degraded Sub-System</p>
<p>The Sub-system, process, procedure, or item has not been delivered to the fleet, has not been developed as required by the requirements document, or as expected to ensure proper system under test operation.</p>
<p>NOTE 11 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Critically Degraded Sub-System</p>
<p>The Sub-system, process, procedure, or item has been delivered to the fleet but it is incomplete, has missing parts, or lacks something that prevents its use in support of the System Under Test as originally intended.</p>
<p>NOTE 12 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Seriously Degraded Sub-System</p>
<p>The Sub-system, process, procedure, or item is incomplete and causes the operator confusion while trying to use the item.  In the case of tools, parts and materials the item is either an incorrect make and mark, or has a defect that prevents use of the item in the System Under Test</p>
<p>NOTE 13 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Moderately Degraded Sub-System</p>
<p>The Sub-system, process, procedure, or item is has a problem that is apparent, but does not stop its use as intended with the System Under Test.  The operator or maintainer can logically deduce the intent of the written material, or figure out how to use an item in spite of the defect.</p>
<p>NOTE 14 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Minor Degraded Sub-System</p>
<p>The Sub-system, process, procedure, or item is has a problem that is apparent, but does not stop its use as intended with the System Under Test.</p>
<p>NOTE 15 (Figure 3 sheet 3 of 4, Figure 4 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>No Deficiency</p>
<p>A No deficiency should not be discarded until after a roll-up assessment has been made. If no additional related deficiencies to the "No deficiency" are found, then the No Deficiency may then be discarded.</p>
<p>NOTE 16 (Figure 4 sheet 3 of 4)</p>
<p>Suitable Substitute/Work-Around</p>
<p>(I.e. The procedure is written in another provided document associated with the system under test, multiple sets of tools are provided in support of the system under test and the deficiency only exists in one set.   A redundant support system that is designed to take over when the primary system fails is not a suitable substitute and should be evaluated as part of the primary system functionality).</p>
<p>NOTE 17 (Figure 5 sheet 1 of 2)</p>
<p>Binning Measures to COI</p>
<p>The Critical Operational Issue that the failed measure is binned to is used as the primary affected Critical Operational Issue.</p>
<p>NOTE 18 (Figure 5 sheet 1 of 2, sheet 2 of 2)</p>
<p>Binning Tasks to COI</p>
<p>The Critical Operational Issue that the failed task or sub-task is binned to is used as the primary affected Critical Operational Issue.</p>
<p>NOTE 19 (Figure 5 sheet 1 of 2)</p>
<p>Binning Secondary Measures to COI</p>
<p>The Critical Operational Issue that the failed measure is binned to is used as the other affected Critical Operational Issue.</p>
<p>NOTE 20 (Figure 5 sheet 1 of 2, sheet 2 of 2)</p>
<p>Binning Secondary Tasks to COI</p>
<p>The Critical Operational Issue that the failed task or sub-task is binned to is used as the other affected Critical Operational Issue.</p>
<p>NOTE 21 (Figure 5 sheet 2 of 2)</p>
<p>Post Test Job Task Analysis</p>
<p>When a failed task/sub-task or measure does not appear on the traceability matrix a post-test Job Task analysis is performed.   After the Post-test Job Task Analysis identifies which 1st level task is affected by the deficiency, the associated COI is used as the affected COI.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-deficiency-analysis-process"><span class="heading-text">1-2 Deficiency Analysis Process</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h3>
<p>A deficiency is defined as an item that is lacking in some necessary quality, capability, or element or not up to a normal standard or complement.  Operational capability is defined as an ability or means that is directly traceable to an approved requirement (e.g., ORD, CDD, CPD, etc).  Mission-essential capability is defined as an ability that is inherently necessary to complete an assigned mission (e.g., a targeting mechanism is required to properly aim a weapon system, but the targeting mechanism/system may not be part of the weapon SUT).</p>
<p>The deficiency analysis process supports the test team in taking a deficiency from classifying through binning to a Critical Operational Issue.  The analysis process is sub-divided into five steps, classification, failure type, severity assessment, roll-up, and binning.</p>
<p>Classification – The classification step helps the test team determine how to classify the deficiency.  The deficiency can either be a support system deficiency, or generate a tactical consideration, operational consideration or recommendation.</p>
<p>Failure Type - The failure type step helps the test team determine whether the deficiency is an operational mission failure/fault or a non-operational mission failure/fault.</p>
<p>Severity Assessment – The severity assessment step helps the test team determine the severity of the deficiency.  The severity assessment can be accomplished qualitatively or quantitatively.  For support systems, the severity assessment will determine the operational impact and utilization criticality of the deficiency.  For operational mission failures and non-operational mission failures, the severity assessment will determine the operational impact and mission criticality of the deficiency.</p>
<p>Roll-up – The deficiency roll-up is an optional step which allows the test team to take related deficiencies (i.e. multiple observed deficiencies on a radar transmitter, or multiple deficiencies on a technical manual, or multiple deficiencies on a missile), and roll-up the impact all the deficiencies have on accomplishment of the mission.</p>
<p>Binning – The binning step helps the test team determine which measure, task or sub-task the deficiency has failed which will ultimately bin the deficiency to a COI.  Primary and when applicable, secondary affected COIs will be identified.</p>
<h4 id="1-2-1-classification"><span class="heading-text">1-2.1 Classification</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>Deficiency reporting has two goals.  The first goal is to provide the program office with notification of a problem that impacts mission accomplishment, the second goal is to provide the fleet with information that can help them accomplish a mission in spite of an identified problem.  The classification step helps the test team identify whether a deficiency will generate a recommendation, operational consideration, or tactical consideration for fleet personnel.  This step will also place the test team on a separate deficiency flow path for system under test support systems.</p>
<h5 id="1-2-1-1-recommendation">1-2.1.1 Recommendation</h5>
<p>When the deficiency is an inconvenience to the operator or maintainer and not a specified requirement in the requirements document, the test team will write a deficiency recommendation.  The recommendation can be written to the program office providing a suggested means to fix an observed inconvenience or it can be a recommendation to the fleet suggesting a means to reduce or eliminate the observed inconvenience.</p>
<p>When writing a recommendation to the program office concerning an observed inconvenience, the test team must describe the problem, state what the problem prevented (the inconvenience), write the recommendation and include how the recommendation would improve/correct the problem.  A recommendation example is provided in Figure 1-2.1.</p>
<h4 id="figure-1-2-1-sample-recommendation"><span class="heading-text">Figure 1-2 .1 Sample Recommendation</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The primary difference between a deficiency and a recommendation is that a deficiency will be written because the system does not meet a written requirement, while a recommendation does not have a specified requirement.</p>
<p>In the example provided in Figure 1-2.1, the operator was able to still meet mission tasking, but every time they worked on one sub-system, they lost situational awareness of the other sub-systems.  During testing, the team observed that while there were 8 sub-systems, only two were ever active at one time.  Several times during the test other participating units sent text messages asking the operator to switch to and check their active sub-system that was not being monitored due to configuration steps that were being done on another sub-system.</p>
<h5 id="1-2-1-2-support-system">1-2.1.2 Support System</h5>
<p>Deficiencies that impact support systems, (i.e. technical documentation, special tools, parts or materials, cooling system, ups, etc.), are analyzed to determine their severity against the intended purpose of the support system.  This requires support systems to be analyzed separately from a deficiency that impacts the system under test directly.</p>
<p>When determining whether an item is a support system, the team must look closely at the System Under Test and analyze how the item works, interfaces, or operates with the system.  In broad terms the system under test can function and meet mission requirements without a support system.  This does not diminish the importance of the support system but frames how to evaluate the support system.</p>
<p>(Note:  Determining whether an item is a support system is critical in ensuring the correct deficiency flow diagram is used.  (E.g. A system has an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS), the system is capable of operation without the UPS as long as normal power is available.  The purpose of the UPS is to allow graceful shutdown of the equipment in the event of primary power loss to the equipment.  The UPS would be treated as a support system.)</p>
<p>When using an UPS as an example, a system can be configured where the UPS is integrated into the power supply and must be fully functional for the system to power on.  A system can also be configured where the UPS is separate from the power supply and is not required for the system to operate.  In first configuration the UPS is not a support system, in the second configuration the UPS is a support system.</p>
<h5 id="1-2-1-3-operational-consideration">1-2.1.3 Operational Consideration</h5>
<p>Operational considerations (OPCONs) are defined and are used to document operational procedures that can be taken by system operators to mitigate shortfalls and deficiencies encountered during operational testing.</p>
<p>The OPCON is written at an operator (O) level using operator terms to explain the operational problem and the solution (work-around) to the shortfall.  The paragraph should provide enough information that a work center can turn the OPCON into a standard operating procedure.  OPCONs can also serve as the starting point for school house and/or afloat training objectives.  A sample OPCON is provided in Figure 1-2.2.</p>
<h4 id="figure-1-2-2-sample-operational-consideration-opcon"><span class="heading-text">Figure 1-2 .2 Sample Operational Consideration (OPCON)</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<h5 id="1-2-1-4-tactical-consideration">1-2.1.4 Tactical Consideration</h5>
<p>Tactical considerations (TACONs) are defined and are used to document tactical considerations that inform operational commanders of significant aspects (pro and con) of system employment, or make clear what special measures would be required to make the system more efficient in operational use.  Although it may present supporting data or examples, it is not a deficiency paragraph by another name.  It is a recommendation for the user to consider in the tactical employment or management of the SUT and/or SoS in operational use.</p>
<p>Tactical employment is a by-product of the IOT&amp;E.  The TACON paragraph is structured for making recommendations to the operational commander to employ the system more effectively and/or to avoid potential shortfalls in TTPs.  When used this way, TACONs serve as the starting point for the OPTEVFOR Tactics Guides (for air warfare projects), and tactics inputs for Commander, Naval Surface Force (for surface programs) and the Undersea Warfare Development Center (for undersea programs). A sample TACON is provided in Figure 1-2.3.</p>

<h5 id="1-2-1-5-deficiency-classification-flow-diagram">1-2.1.5 Deficiency Classification Flow Diagram</h5>
<p>The deficiency classification flow diagram is a tool designed to help the test team determine how to process each deficiency identified during testing.  The flow diagram is presented on Figure 1 in three sheets.  When using the flow diagram, the test team should discuss the test observations for each deficiency and review the requirements document before choosing a path.</p>
<h4 id="1-2-2-failure-type"><span class="heading-text">1-2.2 Failure Type</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>A casualty can either be an operational mission failure/fault or a non-operational mission failure/fault.  This determination must be made so the test team can ensure Reliability, Maintainability and Availability of the system is computed correctly.  Operational Mission failures/faults also generate deficiency sheets while non-operational mission failures/faults usually do not.</p>
<p>If during test you observe a failure or fault that is not an operational mission failure or fault, but is persistent (shows up more than once), or causes the operator to perform some type of workaround, a blue sheet may be warranted.  The test team needs to analyze each failure and fault and determine whether a blue sheet should be generated.</p>
<p>To effectively determine whether the deficiency is an operational mission failure the test team must properly identify the mission, and identify whether the system under test is standalone, networked or multi-node.</p>
<p>Some Critical Operational Issues are supportive.  While they still have an assigned mission (i.e. C3 primary mission is Command, Control and Communication), when assessing the impact a deficiency has on a mission, both the primary mission and supported mission(s) must be analyzed to determine whether there is an Operational Mission Failure. (I.e. The Commander may have an alternate means to communicate, but for an ASW mission the SUT is the only means for providing communications to support the ASW mission).  The Operational Mission Failure would be driven by the ASW mission, not the C3 mission.</p>
<p>Identifying whether a system is stand-alone, networked or multi-node helps with determining if a deficiency has caused a mission to stop, or just reduced the full capability of the system.  Some examples of different system types are as follows;</p>
<p>1. Satellite communication system with receive suites is a multi-node SUT where the Satellite (node 1), has a mission requirement and the receive suite (node 2) has a mission requirement.  A casualty that prevents either node of the SUT from meeting its mission requirement is an Operational Mission Failure.  (Note: Both nodes are required for operations to be successful, but each node has a different mission to perform.  Loss of either one prevents mission accomplishment).</p>
<p>2. A Fire Control Radar suite with three illuminator radars is a networked system that would be degraded casualty situation if either one of the illuminators stopped working, but an Operational Mission Failure if they all stopped working. (Note:  The mission of guiding missiles can still be accomplished with one illuminator even though the system would be in a degraded state).</p>
<p>3. A networked computer suite with a server and connected computers is a networked system where each connected computer replicates the capability of the next.  The server going down, or the connected computers reduced down past a minimum number would be an Operational Mission Failure. (Note: The minimum number of accepted connected computers would have to be established to determine mission criticality.  (E.g. If the network has twelve computers connected to the server and out of the twelve, four stations must be operational to support the overall mission of the network, then you would not reach an operational mission failure until you were down to three connected computers or you have loss of the server)).</p>
<p>4. A new computer that is designed to work on an existing network, is a stand-alone system that would be an Operational Mission Failure if that new stand-alone computer stopped working. (Note: In this example the existing network is the System of Systems, and the new computer is the System Under Test).</p>
<h5 id="1-2-2-1-failure-type-flow-diagram">1-2.2.1 Failure Type Flow Diagram</h5>
<p>The failure type flow diagram is a tool designed to help the test team determine whether a deficiency should be classified as an operational mission failure or non-operational mission failure.  The flow diagram is presented on Figure 2 in three sheets.  For this flow diagram to be effective the test team must have a clear understanding of the mission that the system under test is providing or supporting.</p>
<h4 id="1-2-3-severity-assessment"><span class="heading-text">1-2.3 Severity Assessment</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The severity of deficiencies are determined by making either a quantitative or qualitative assessment.  The baseline deficiency flow diagrams are designed to help with assessing the severity of the deficiencies.  The flow diagrams are sub-divided to cover either a System Under Test that has a new capability, or a System Under Test that is replacing or upgrading an existing capability.  A New Capability is a System that brings a means where no regressive capability previously existed.  An existing capability system is a system that is expanding or upgrading a capability that already exists.  When assessing new capability systems, how the deficiency impacts the regressive capability will be factored into the severity calculation.</p>
<p>The System Under Test will most often have some type of sub-system, or component that is used in support of the system under test.  (E.g. test equipment, special tools, technical manuals, etc.).  These support items normally will not immediately prevent the system under test from executing the primary mission when they are deficient, but are required to be effective upon delivery to the fleet.  Each support item will be assessed based on how the support item performs in relation to how it is supposed to perform.  (I.e. how well the technical documentation provides the fleet with the information needed to operate and maintain the system under test).  To determine the severity of the support system, the support equipment baseline deficiency flow diagram is used.</p>
<p>Though the support system or sub-system may not immediately prevent the SUT from accomplishing the mission, the test team must determine the long term impact of the deficiency.  For example, if preventive maintenance system cards are not properly written which prevents the Sailor from performing routine periodic maintenance, eventually the SUT will experience a failure or fault.  A system SME is needed to help with determining the long term impact of not being able to perform the system maintenance.</p>
<p>The system under test deficiency flow diagrams are used in two steps.  Depending on whether the test team is using the qualitative or quantitative flow diagram, the first step will determine the mission impact or operational impact of the deficiency.  The second step will determine the mission criticality of the deficiency.  The support system flow diagram is also executed in two steps.  The first step will determine the operational impact of the deficiency and the second step will determine the utilization criticality of the deficiency.</p>
<h5 id="1-2-3-1-qualitative-baseline-flow-diagram">1-2.3.1 Qualitative Baseline Flow Diagram</h5>
<p>The Qualitative Baseline Flow Diagram is a tool designed to help the test team determine the criticality of a deficiency by using a non-statistical methodical approach.  The qualitative diagrams focus on how the deficiency impacts pre-mission or mission execution.  The flow diagram is presented on Figure 3 in four sheets.  The test team will only need to use one of the four sheets for each casualty.  Sheet 1 covers systems that provide a new capability.  Sheet 2 covers systems that are upgrading an existing capability.  Sheet 3 covers support systems and sheet 4 is only used when rolling up deficiencies.</p>
<p>The operational impact of a deficiency identifies how critical the deficiency is related to system under test mission accomplishment.  When on test, the test team needs to observe how the deficiency impacts the mission.  While observing, the tester is looking to answer the following questions;</p>
<p>Is the deficiency occurring during pre-mission setup?</p>
<p>Does the deficiency prevent the mission from starting on time?</p>
<p>Does mission execution take longer than planned?</p>
<p>Does mission execution require a work around?</p>
<p>Can the mission be successfully accomplished?</p>
<p>The qualitative baseline flow diagram operational impact determination can result in one of five mission impacts (Minor, Moderate, Serious, Critical and Severe). Each of the operational impacts are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Severe Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as a mission that cannot be executed or the mission must be aborted before reaching its successful conclusion.  The deficiency prevents the SUT from executing its designed mission or while executing the mission, the deficiency causes the SUT to abort mission support or, the SUT in its intended operational environment cannot perform its designed/intended mission.  (Mission cannot be executed).</p>
<p>Critical Impact to Mission Accomplishment - The mission can be executed, but requires a work around to ensure its successful conclusion.  The deficiency prevents the SUT from operating as intended, but the mission can be completed by implementing a work around, or the SUT in its intended operational environment cannot perform its intended mission as designed, a work around must be used to ensure mission completion.  (Mission execution requires a work around to reach successful conclusion).</p>
<p>Serious Impact to Mission Accomplishment - The mission can be executed, but expected mission completion time will be delayed.  The deficiency does not prevent the SUT from executing its designed mission, but it takes the SUT longer to execute the mission than expected, or the SUT in its intended operational environment can perform its intended mission, but mission time takes longer than expected.  (Mission execution takes longer than planned).</p>
<p>Moderate Impact to Mission Accomplishment - Planning for the mission is delayed causing a delay in mission execution, but the mission can be successfully completed.  The deficiency causes delays in SUT pre-planning, configuration, and/or startup, delaying planned mission start time, but not affecting overall mission completion, or preparations for SUT operation take longer than planned causing delays in the SUT mission start time, but no impact on mission completion.  (Mission preparations/planning is delayed, mission start is delayed, but the mission is executable).</p>
<p>Minor Impact to Mission Accomplishment - Planning for the mission is delayed, but the mission can be executed on time, and reach its successful conclusion.  The deficiency causes delays in SUT pre-planning, configuration, and/or startup, but does not delay mission start time or impact  overall mission completion, or preparations for SUT operation take longer than planned, but does not affect mission start, or mission completion.  (Mission preparations/planning is delayed, mission execution starts on time and is successful).</p>
<p>The mission criticality determination of a deficiency determines how critical the mission impact is related to accomplishment of the mission.  During test observation the team must ask the operator/commander whether the mission impact results are acceptable.  (I.e. A moderate impact to mission accomplishment due a mission start time delay would have to be assessed to determine whether the start time delay is acceptable to the operator/commander to consider the overall mission a success).  The qualitative baseline flow diagram mission criticality determination can result in one of five mission criticality levels (Minor, Moderate, Serious, Critical and Severe).  Each of the mission criticality levels are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Minor Deficiency – The pre-mission delay is acceptable, there are no adverse effects on the Sailor executing the pre-mission tasks.</p>
<p>Major 3 Deficiency - The pre-mission delay is not acceptable or there are adverse effects on the Sailor executing the pre-mission tasks.  A mission start time delay that is acceptable can also result in a Major 3 deficiency.</p>
<p>Major 2 Deficiency – The mission start time delay is not acceptable for considering mission execution a success.  A delayed mission completion time that is acceptable can also result in a Major 2 deficiency.</p>
<p>Major 1 Deficiency – The mission completion time delay is not acceptable for considering mission execution a success.  An implemented work around that is acceptable and reasonable for operators to implement and achieve consistent mission success can also result in a Major 1 deficiency.</p>
<p>Severe Deficiency – The operational impact is severe, or an implemented work around is not acceptable or reasonable, or the operators do not achieve consistent mission success with the implemented work around.</p>
<p>Once the deficiency has been assessed qualitatively, the conclusion statement on the deficiency sheet will provide an operational impact and mission criticality.  The following problem and conclusion statement is provided as a sample.</p>
<p>SAMPLE PROBLEM STATEMENT:  The mission computer did not retain navigation data after a full system power down process. (Major 2).  SAMPLE CONCLUSION STATEMENT: The mission computer not retaining navigation data after a full system power down process has a Moderate operational impact and is a Major 2 mission deficiency.</p>
<h5 id="1-2-3-2-quantitative-baseline-flow-diagram">1-2.3.2 Quantitative Baseline Flow Diagram</h5>
<p>The Quantitative Baseline Flow Diagram is a tool designed to help the test team determine the criticality of a deficiency by using a statistical measured approach.  The quantitative flow diagram questions center around percentage of loss of system/application use.  The flow diagram is presented on Figure 4 in four sheets.  The test team will only need to use one of the four sheets for each casualty.  Sheet 1 covers systems that provide a new capability.  Sheet 2 covers systems that are upgrading an existing capability.  Sheet 3 covers support systems and sheet 4 is only used when rolling up deficiencies.</p>
<p>The operational impact of a deficiency identifies how critical the deficiency is related to system under test operation.  When on test, the test team needs to observe how degraded the system is because of the deficiency.  The test team is observing what percentage of system capability is still present with the deficiency.  The quantitative baseline flow diagram operational impact determination can result in one of five operational impacts (Minor, Moderate, Serious, Critical and Severe).  Each of the operational impacts are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Severe Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as a total loss of system functionality. (New Capabilities or New and Existing Capabilities are not available).</p>
<p>Critical Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as greater or equal to 50% loss of primary application functionality or performance resulting in in users unable to perform their normal functions. The operational impact is also critical if an inconvenient workaround is required, or no work-around for a problem is available.  (Major feature or product failure with partial loss of secondary capabilities or features).</p>
<p>(Note: A work-around must exist within the SUT and not be the use of another system or function that is not part of the SUT.  Inconvenience to the operator is any work-around that that is not intuitive and requires some type of training or muscle memory to ensure successful operation of the SUT).</p>
<p>Serious Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as a 25 to 49% (partial) loss of primary application functionality or performance resulting in users not being able to perform their normal functions.  An inconvenient work around exists. (Partial loss of primary capabilities).</p>
<p>Moderate Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as less than 25% loss of primary application functionality or performance resulting in a low number of users unable to perform their normal functions and a work around (if required) exists).  (Degraded use of primary application).</p>
<p>Minor Impact to Mission Accomplishment – Defined as having total primary system functionality or performance, but less than threshold requirements and no work-around is required.  (All primary capabilities exists with no problems).</p>
<p>The mission criticality determination of a deficiency determines how critical the mission impact is related to accomplishment of the mission.  After determining the operational impact of the deficiency, the test team determines what percentage of mission capability still exists.  In the quantitative assessment, a system may have a moderate degradation to system performance (less than 24% loss of primary application functionality), but that small loss of performance may result in a 50% loss of mission capability.  In that instance a moderate operational impact can result in a Major 1 mission impact.  The quantitative baseline flow diagram mission criticality determination can result in one of five mission criticality levels (Minor, Moderate, Serious, Critical and Severe).  Each of the mission criticality levels are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Minor Deficiency – You have a zero to 14% loss of mission capability.</p>
<p>Major 3 Deficiency – You have a 15 to 24% loss of mission capability.</p>
<p>Major 2 Deficiency – You have a 25 to 49% loss of mission capability.</p>
<p>Major 1 Deficiency – You have a 50 to 75% loss of mission capability.</p>
<p>Severe Deficiency – You have above 75% loss of mission capability.</p>
<p>Once the deficiency has been assessed quantitatively, the conclusion statement on the deficiency sheet will provide the mission impact and mission criticality.  The following problem and conclusion statement is provided as a sample.</p>
<p>SAMPLE PROBLEM STATEMENT:  The Surface Supervisor Operator Console display did not power on during execution of the display suite start-up process. (Minor).  SAMPLE CONCLUSION STATEMENT: The Surface Supervisor Operator console display not powering on during the display suite start-up process has a Minor operational impact and is a Minor mission deficiency.</p>
<p>Further discussion concerning conclusion statements are found in paragraph 2-2.</p>

<h4 id="1-2-4-deficiency-roll-up"><span class="heading-text">1-2.4 Deficiency Roll-up</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The deficiency roll-up flow diagrams are provided as part of the qualitative and quantitative baseline flow diagrams as sheet 4.  These diagrams are not mandatory, but in certain situations the test team may feel the need to highlight a larger issue with the observed deficiencies.</p>
<p>Deficiencies are written as individual deficiency sheets.  However, there may be times when a system or sub-system make have multiple deficiencies that are related.  In a multiple related deficiency situation the test team has the option to assess impact the combined deficiency has on the system performance.  The deficiency roll-up can be assessed either quantitatively or qualitatively.  How to write the deficiency roll-up blue sheet is provided in paragraph 2-1.</p>
<h4 id="1-2-5-binning-deficiencies"><span class="heading-text">1-2.5 Binning Deficiencies</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The final step in the deficiency analysis process is binning the deficiency to the applicable Critical Operational Issue.  The Binning flow diagram is a tool designed to help the test team determine which critical operational issue deficiency should be binned to.  The flow diagram is presented on Figure 5 in two sheets.</p>
<p>Correct binning relies on a properly developed traceability matrix during the Integrated Evaluation Framework development phase.  The flow diagram has the test bin the deficiency by looking at what failed on the traceability matrix.  (I.e. Did a data requirement, measure, sub-task or task fail).  The Critical Operational Issue that has the failed data requirement, measure, sub-task or task linked to it will be the primary critical operational issue that the deficiency will be binned to.</p>
<p>When a data requirement, measure, sub-task or task that has been identified during the Integrated Evaluation Framework phase is not impacted by the deficiency, the test team will have to execute a job task analysis on the observed deficiency and apply the results to the existing traceability matrix.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-deficiency-roll-up"><span class="heading-text">2-1 Deficiency Roll-up</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h3>
<p>OPTEVFOR presents deficiencies to stakeholders as single problems on a Blue or Gold sheet.  However, there are times when a System Under Test or System of System has multiple deficiencies that are related.  When defining related deficiencies, the test team must understand the following,</p>
<p>Multiple deficiencies that may cause the same data requirement, measure, sub-task or task to fail are not necessarily related.  (E.g. A measure to check that the system under test interfaces with a system of system network may fail during one test period because a power supply failed in the system under test power supply section.  During the next test period the software in the data interface section faults.  During the final test period the Human Machine Interface doesn’t power on which prevents the interface.  While all three results in the same failed measure, the deficiencies are not related).</p>
<p>The same observed failure is not required to be rolled up. (E.g. The power supply in the system under test consistently failed and had to be replaced every time the unit was turned on.  This failure can be captured in one blue sheet that describes how many times the casualty was observed and the conditions under which that casualty was caused).</p>
<p>The deficiency roll-up is designed to take multiple deficiencies that have a low criticality assessment as stand-alone issues, but when looked at collectively they result in a high criticality assessment.  (E.g. The preventative maintenance system (PMS) does not provide the maintainer with a procedure for cleaning filters and the equipment overheated during test.  The PMS did not provide a procedure for backing up the operating system on a weekly basis prior to anti-virus updates.  The update crashed the system and required the maintainers to reload the complete software package, instead of restoring to a previous state.  The PMS procedure for doing Built In Test (BIT) was for the previous system configuration and had not been updated to cover the new system.  The maintainer could not perform BIT to verify the system operability status.  While all of these may result in minor to moderate deficiencies individually.  Collectively, the issues would result in a higher criticality assessment).</p>
<h4 id="2-1-1-deficiency-roll-up-numbering"><span class="heading-text">2-1.1 Deficiency Roll-up Numbering</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4>
<p>The numbering system for rolled up deficiencies show the relation with a primary number and alphabetical sub-labels.  The TEIN will make up the first four numbers in the deficiency number followed by the assigned three digit number (e.g. TEIN-003).  The related deficiencies will have the same primary number (TEIN-003) followed by an alphabetical designation (e.g. a, b, c, etc).  Figure 2-1.2 shows deficiency numbering.</p>
<p>2-1.2 Deficiency Roll-up Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 is written in the same format as a standard deficiency sheet with the exception that the paragraph will describe the combined problem.  The primary critical operational issue will be the COI that all or most the deficiencies impact.  The other affected COIs will list the remaining COIs affected by all the deficiencies.  Whether it was previously identified and whether it is a derived requirement does not apply for the roll-up sheet.  In the sample provided the deficiencies are all related to technical documentation.  Figure 2-1.1 shows a sample paragraph 1.</p>
<p>2-1.3 Deficiency Roll-up Paragraph 2</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 describes the overall test conditions that apply to all the related deficiencies with the results of each individual deficiency captured in a table.  The detailed test conditions, results and analysis is captured on the individual deficiency sheet and is not repeated on the roll-up sheet.  Figure 2-1.2 shows a sample paragraph 2.</p>

<p>2-1.4 Deficiency Roll-up Paragraph 3</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 will describe how the combined deficiencies impact mission accomplishment.  This requires the test team to analyze and determine what the combined mission impact would have been if the deficiencies were never all seen at once.  When they have been observed during one test period, the test team should write what the observed combined impact was.  The test team should not copy all the individual mission relations and try to combine them into one statement on the roll-up sheet.

<p>2-1.6 Deficiency Roll-up Paragraph 5</p>
<p>The paragraph 5 write up provides a recommendation to the program office for each of the deficiencies.  The best situation would be all deficiencies corrected prior to fleet release of the system under test.  But assuming that cannot happen, the recommendation should prioritize the correction and describe how fixing the deficiency will benefit the fleet.  A sample paragraph 5 is shown in figure 2-1.5.</p><h4 id="figure-2-1-5"><span class="heading-text">Figure 2-1.5 Sample Blue Sheet Roll-Up Paragraph 5</span><span class="heading-toc-link"><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></span></h4><img alt="Sample Blue Sheet Roll-Up Paragraph 5" class="manual-figure" src="./images/figure-2-1-5.png"/>

<p>2-1.7 Deficiency Roll-up Verification Correction of Deficiency</p>
<p>When a Verification Correction of Deficiency is executed, or a follow-on operational test event and rolled-up deficiencies are found to be corrected, but not all of them, the test team must re-assess the impact the deficiencies have on accomplishing the mission and revise the roll-up deficiency sheet assessment.</p>
